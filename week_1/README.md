Digital image processing helps us enhance images to make them visually pleasing, or accentuate regions or
features of the image to better represent the content. For example, we may wish to enhance the brightness
and contrast to make a better print of a photograph, similar to popular photo-processing software. In a
magnetic resonance image of the brain, we may want to accentuate a certain region of image intensities to
see the certain parts of the brain. Image analysis and computer vision, which go beyond image processing,
help us to make decisions based on the contents of the image. Computer vision extensively uses machine
learning, particularly deep learning. This course will first give you the basic knowledge required to enter
into this exciting field, and equip you with basic tools to do image processing and computer vision. In the
latter part of the course, we will learn to apply the knowledge in real problems.
This course is a pre-requisite for EN4584 Advances in Computer Vision. The follow-up module EN4554
Deep Learning for Vision will be offered in the semester 7. This will be helpful for EN3150 Pattern Recognition (co-offered) EN4574 Advanced Pattern Recognition offered in semester 7.
